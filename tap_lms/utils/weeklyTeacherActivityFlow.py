# Teacher Weekly Activity Automation
# File: tap_lms/utils/teacher_weekly_activity.py
#
# This module provides functions for:
# 1. get_weekly_teachers() - Creates a weekly snapshot of eligible teachers with their batch assignments
# 2. trigger_teacher_weekly_activity() - Triggers Glific flows for each teacher in the weekly snapshot
#
# Scheduled to run weekly (e.g., Monday morning IST)
