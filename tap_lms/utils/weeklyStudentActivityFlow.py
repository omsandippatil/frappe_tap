# Student Weekly Activity Automation
# File: tap_lms/utils/student_weekly_activity.py
#
# This module provides functions for:
# 1. get_weekly_students() - Creates a weekly snapshot of eligible students with their batch assignments
# 2. trigger_student_weekly_activity() - Triggers Glific flows for each student in the weekly snapshot
#
# Scheduled to run weekly (e.g., Monday morning IST)
